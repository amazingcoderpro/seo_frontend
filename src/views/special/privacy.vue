              <p>This privacy statement discloses the privacy practices for PinBooster. We are committed to protecting your privacy and encourage you to periodically review this page to be informed of how we protect the information you disclose to us.</p>
              <p class="title">What personal information does PinBooster collect?</p>
              <p>The information we gather from customers enables us to personalize and improve our services and to allow our users to set up a user account and profile that can be used to interact with other users through the Website. We collect the following types of information from our customers:</p>
              <p>We receive and store any information you provide to us, it may include your real name, username, email address, IP address, location, browser information, browsing history, transactions, listings created, comments and reviews posted, and any other information necessary for us to provide our services as well as credentials you provide us to link your PinBooster account with Pinterest. If you provide your third-party account credentials to us, you understand some content and/or information in that account ("Third Party Account Information") may be transmitted into your account with us if you authorize such transmissions, and that Third Party Account Information transmitted to our Website is covered by this Privacy Policy. You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but then you may not be able to register with us or to take advantage of some of our features. We may anonymize your Personal Information so that you cannot be individually identified, and provide that information to our partners.</p>
              <p>We automatically receive and record information on our server logs from your browser whenever you interact with our Website, including your IP address, "cookie" information, and the page you requested. "Cookies" are identifiers we transfer to your computer through your browser that allow us to recognize your browser or mobile device and tell us how and when pages in our site are visited and by how many people. We may also record other information about the type of Web browser, computer, platform you are using. You may be able to change the preferences on your browser to prevent or limit your computer's acceptance of cookies, but this may prevent you from taking advantage of PinBooster's best features. Our advertising partners may also transmit cookies to your computer, when you click on ads that appear on our site. This Privacy Policy does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.</p>
              <p>When we collect usage information (such as the numbers and frequency of visitors to the Website), we only use this data in aggregate form, and not in a manner that would identify you personally. For example, this aggregate data tells us how often users use parts of the Website, so that we can make the Website appealing to as many users as possible. We may also provide this aggregate information to our partners, so that they can understand how often people use their services and our Website, so that they, too, can provide you with an optimal online experience. We never disclose aggregate information to a partner in a manner that would identify you personally.</p>
              <p class="title">Use of Personal Information</p>
              <p>In general, we use your personal information for 3 purposes:</p>
              <p>To request feedback and to enable us to develop, customize and improve the Web site and our publications, products and services; to conduct marketing analysis, to send you surveys or newsletters, to contact you about services, products, activities, special events or offers from PinBooster or our partners and for other marketing, informational, product development and promotional purposes; </p>
              <p>To send you a welcoming email and to contact you about your use of the Web site and services; to respond to your emails, submissions, comments, requests or complaints; to perform after-sales services; to anticipate and resolve problems with our service;</p>
              <p>To respond to customer support inquiries, for assistance with our product and service development; and to inform you of updates to products and services from PinBooster that better meet your needs. </p>
              <p>For other purposes about which we will notify you immediately.</p>
              <p class="title">Cookies</p>
              <p>A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's hard drive containing information about the user. We use both session and persistent cookies. Cookies enable us to track and target the interests of our users in the aggregate by analyzing popular areas and products to enhance future experiences on our site. Cookies do not cause damage to your computer systems or files, and only the web site that transferred a particular cookie to you can read, modify or delete such cookie. If you do not want information collected through the use of cookies, there are simple procedures in most browsers that allow you to delete existing cookies, to automatically decline cookies, or to be given the choice of declining or accepting the transfer of particular cookies to your computer.</p>
              <p class="title">Email and Other Communications</p>
              <p>If a user wishes to sign up or subscribe to PinBooster, we ask for contact information such as name, street address and e-mail address to provide these communications, then you will be automatically opted in to receive email notices, newsletters and announcements. We may receive a confirmation when you open an email from us. This confirmation helps us make emails more interesting and improve our service. If you do not want to receive email or other mail from us, please use the unsubscribe feature in our e-mail. If you send an email using the service to an email address that is not registered in our community, we do not use that email address for any purpose other than to send your email. We do not rent or sell these email addresses, nor do we send them marketing messages.</p>
              <p class="title">Security</p>
              <p>PinBooster takes every precaution to protect our users' information. When our registration/order form asks users to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number and/or social security number), that information is encrypted and is protected with the Secure Socket Layers (SSLs) encryption software. While on a secure page, such as our order form, a lock icon appears on the bottom of your Web browser. When you are not on a secure page, no lock icon will appear. In addition, the servers that we store personally identifiable information on are kept in a secure environment under restricted access. In addition, always logout and close your browser when you finish your session. Please note that we will never ask you to disclose your password in an unsolicited phone call or email.</p>
              <p class="title">Changes to This Policy</p>
              <p>We reserve the right to change this privacy policy, and any of our policies or procedures concerning the treatment of information collected through the site, without prior notice. You can determine when this privacy policy was last revised by referring to date at the top of this page. Any changes to our privacy policy will become effective upon posting of the revised policy on the Internet, accessible through the site. Use of the site following such changes constitutes your acceptance of the revised policy then in effect. We encourage you to periodically review our privacy policy to ensure familiarity with our most current version.</p>
              <p class="title">Questions or concerns</p>
              <p>If you have any questions or concerns regarding our privacy policies, please feel free to contact us anytime at service@pinbooster.seamarketings.com. We will make every effort to resolve your concerns.</p>
